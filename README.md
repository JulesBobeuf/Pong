## About The Project

**Pong Unity Clone** is a 2D Pong game developed using Unity and C#. This project was created as part of a personal learning experience, following the C# Masterclass by Denis Panjuta on Udemy.
In this game, players control paddles to bounce a ball back and forth. This specific variant is intended for single players, as the computer plays as Player 2.
